# RAMSES - A Reusable Autonomic Manager for MicroServicES
MSc final thesis project by Vincenzo Riccio and Giancarlo Sorrentino.

## Project composition

This project is a Self-Adaptive System made of:

1. a [managed system](./managed-system/README.md), SEFA, which is the software object of adaptation.
2. a reusable [managing system](./managing-system/README.md), RAMSES, which is the software responsible of adapting the managed system.
3. some simulated [third party services](./third-party-services/README.md) used by the managed system

## Software Architecture
